      <h2>Nigerian Ewedu Soup</h2>
        <p>Ewedu soup, also known as jute leaves soup, is a thick, viscous Nigerian soup usually eaten with Nigerian stew and fufu dishes!</p>
        <p>Ewedu soup is a savory soup commonly eaten by the Yorubatribe in Nigeria. It is made using jute leaves, a highly nutritious leafy green plant eaten in countries all around the world.</p>
      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Frozen ewedu: the one I am using is already blended but they sometimes come unblended</li>
            <li>Ground crayfish</li>
            <li>Egusi (ground melon seed) this is optional</li>
            <li>Iru (locust beans) if you are reading this from Nigeria then you may have access to iru Pete which is traditionally added to the soup</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Bouillon powder.</li>
        </ul>
       <h2>Steps in preparing Ewedu Soup</h2>
         <ol>
            <li>Defrost the frozen molokhia: you can use the defrost function of your microwave to achieve this or soak the frozen vegetable while still in the bag in warm water. Another way to defrost frozen jute leaves is by leaving it in the fridge overnight.</li>
            <li>Place a pan on low-medium heat, add Â¾ cup of water and bring to a gentle boil for about a minute (this is assuming you will be cooking 400g of frozen jute leaves) then add the melon paste to the boiling water in bits followed by the washed locust beans</li>
            <li>Do not stir as you want the melon to solidify a bit. cook on medium heat for 2 minutes or so the stir to combine, break the lumps of egusi with the back of the spoon.</li>
            <li>Pour the thawed ewedu into the pot and stir to combine. Add ground crayfish, salt, and bouillon powder, stir and bring to a gentle boil for another 3 minutes. Taste and adjust the seasoning to suit your preference.</li>
            <li>Take if off the heat immediately and serve with your Nigerian soup of choice.</li>
         </ol>
         <p>Ewedu is traditionally served with soups such as beef stew, chicken stew, fish stew, or buka stew and then accompanied with a swallow of choice. The popular swallow you can serve it with includes fufu, eba, or amala.

            You can also serve this green soup with gbegiri for some abula experience.</p>
